# Data Model: Optimization & Quality Improvements

**Feature**: 002-optimization-improvements  
**Status**: N/A (No new entities)

## Overview

This feature focuses on build optimization, test quality, and platform support improvements. It does NOT introduce new data structures or modify existing snapshot formats.

## No Changes Required

### Existing Data Model (from 001-disk-usage-cli)

**Snapshot Format** (Parquet schema):
```rust
Schema {
  path: String (UTF-8),
  size: u64,
  physical_size: u64,
  depth: u16,
  entry_type: u32 (enum: 0=File, 1=Dir, 2=Symlink, 3=Other),
}
```

**Rationale for no changes**:
- Binary size optimization affects build configuration, not runtime data
- Test improvements don't require new entities
- Windows support uses existing fields (no Windows-specific fields needed)
- Parquet feature optimization is internal to build, not schema

### Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Guaranteed**: All existing snapshot files remain readable.

- Parquet feature changes (arrow + snap) do not affect schema
- Compression is metadata, not schema-level change
- No version field changes needed

## Future Considerations

If future features require data model changes, this section will be populated. For this optimization phase, the existing data model from MVP is sufficient.
