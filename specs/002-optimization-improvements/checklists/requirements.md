## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Pass**: All checklist items passed on first review

### Content Quality ✅
- Specification is written in plain language focusing on "what" and "why"
- No specific implementation details like frameworks or APIs
- Describes user needs (Windows support, smaller binary, better tests) rather than technical solutions
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear
- Each FR has testable acceptance criteria in User Stories
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (binary size <7MB, coverage ≥80%, test count, build time)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "binary size reduces" not "strip with specific tool")
- User stories include acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identified (Windows build failures, performance regressions, tool availability)
- Scope section clearly defines in-scope and out-of-scope items
- Dependencies (windows-sys, cargo-bloat, coverage tools) and assumptions (toolchain availability) documented

### Feature Readiness ✅
- Each of 22 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 4 user stories (P1-P3) cover all primary flows: Windows support, size optimization, test quality, Parquet optimization
- Success criteria are independently measurable: SC-001 (Windows build), SC-002 (7MB target), SC-004 (80% coverage), etc.
- Specification stays at "what" level - no mention of specific Rust features, cargo commands, or implementation strategies

### Specific Requirement Review

**Windows Support (FR-001 to FR-005)**:
- Clear testable requirements: builds on Windows, uses GetCompressedFileSizeW, handles backslash paths
- User Story 1 provides acceptance scenarios for each requirement
- Success criterion SC-001 validates Windows build success

**Binary Size (FR-006 to FR-010)**:
- Measurable requirements: enable LTO, document with cargo bloat, minimal features, maintain functionality, strip symbols
- User Story 2 provides step-by-step acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria SC-002 (size <7MB), SC-006 (build time <3min), SC-007 (no perf regression) validate outcomes

**Test Organization (FR-011 to FR-014)**:
- Clear requirements: accurate names, remove deprecated tests, follow structure, clear assertions
- User Story 3 acceptance scenarios validate each requirement
- Success criterion SC-005 (zero misleading names) is measurable

**Test Coverage (FR-015 to FR-018)**:
- Testable requirements: provide coverage measurement, identify uncovered lines, achieve 80%, generate HTML
- User Story 3 scenarios cover coverage generation and review
- Success criterion SC-004 (80% coverage) is quantifiable

**Parquet Optimization (FR-019 to FR-022)**:
- Specific requirements: audit APIs, configure features, validate functionality, document constraints
- User Story 4 provides independent test scenarios
- Success criterion SC-002 indirectly validates if Parquet optimization contributes to size reduction

**NFRs are well-defined**:
- Performance: specific thresholds (5% scan, 10% view regression tolerance)
- UX: no interface changes, Windows path display
- Code quality: cfg gates, error handling, documentation
- Testing: platform coverage, CI integration, coverage targets
- Build: LTO settings, strip configuration, build time documentation

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All requirements are clear, testable, and well-scoped. No clarifications needed.
